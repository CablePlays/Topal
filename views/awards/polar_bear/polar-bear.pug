    Mr Neil Solomon, who introduced the Outdoor Pursuits and Post-Matric programmes to Treverton,
    instituted this unique and exclusive club.
    It is based upon other crazy awards around the world where people brave frigid waters.
    This experience is said to aid in the body's immunity against illness due to an increase in antioxidant production in the body.
    So if for nothing else, do it for your health!
