      Treverton's Outdoor Pursuits Programme is well established and the various activities are now synonymous with the ever increasingly popular
      adventure and extreme sports.
      It is with thanks to the late Mr Neil Solomon, who founded the Treverton Outdoor Pursuits Programme and the Post Matriculation Course,
      and Mr Graham Lind for their forethought and hard work that they put into developing the Outdoor Pursuits Programme and this logbook.

    p.
      As Adventure Tourism increasingly becomes more popular in South Africa there is a greater demand for qualified adventure guides who are
      registered with the South African Qualifications Authority (CATHSETA).

      The growing outdoor-adventure industry is a potential source of employment and already a significant number of old Trevertonians
      are employed in this sector.  Not only is Treverton College of service in the development of individuals, in terms of personality,
      character and leadership skills, through the Outdoor Pursuits Programme, but also increasingly of use in giving individuals a competitive
      advantage for entering into the Adventure Tourism industry in South Africa.

    h2.heading Safety First

    .spacer.v20

    p.
      There is always going to be an inherent risk in doing some of these activities.
      Learners should familiarize themselves with the risks and make sure that they know the necessary skills required in order to do a particular activity.
      For example: Train first to get fit before attempting your first 15km road running race or Adventure Race,
      practice paddling on flat water before attempting to shoot a rapid, don't play with snakes as they may be dangerous and you're a long way
      from help and don't eat or consume anything found in the veld (such as mushrooms, seeds or berries) as they may be poisonous and detrimental to
      your well-being.  This list is not exhaustive and by using your common sense will go a long way in ensuring that you have an incredible
      journey of achievement and enjoyment as you overcome your fears, reach your personal goals and have fun in God's creation.

    h2.heading What is the Outdoor Pursuits Awards Scheme?

    .spacer.v20

    p.
      The Treverton Outdoor Pursuits Awards Scheme consists of twelve major awards, with higher levels
      (Instructor and Leader) attainable in all the award disciplines.

    .spacer.v20

    p.
      Learners voluntarily work towards achievement of these awards by following the standards and rules laid out in the Outdoor Pursuits Logbook.
      Learners do this mainly in their own time although some instruction is given during Grade 8, 9 and 10 O.P. lessons.  
      Learners work at their own pace and by a series of "sign-offs" in their logbooks gradually achieve their awards.
